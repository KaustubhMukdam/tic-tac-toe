# 🎮 Project 3/20 – Advanced Tic Tac Toe Game with AI

This is the **third project** in my **100 Days of Code – Portfolio Project Series**.  
Based on Day 84 of Dr. Angela Yu’s Bootcamp, what started as a simple text-based Tic Tac Toe turned into an **advanced project** featuring multiple AI difficulty levels and game theory implementation. 🚀

## 🚀 Features

### Game Modes
- **Human vs Human** – Classic two-player mode  
- **Human vs Easy AI** – Play against a random-move AI opponent  
- **Human vs Hard AI** – Challenge yourself against an unbeatable minimax AI  
- **Easy AI vs Hard AI** – Watch AI opponents compete (simulation mode)  
- **Hard AI vs Hard AI** – Observe perfect gameplay between two AIs  

### AI Implementation
- **Easy AI** – Random strategy for casual play  
- **Hard AI** – Minimax algorithm for unbeatable gameplay  
- **Game Theory** – Recursive evaluation of all possible moves  

### User Experience
- Continuous play with multiple exit options  
- Clear 3×3 grid with position numbers (1–9)  
- Win/loss/tie tracking in simulation modes  
- Robust input validation and error handling

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Algorithm
The **Hard AI** uses the **Minimax Algorithm**:  
- Recursively evaluates all possible game states  
- Assumes optimal play from both players  
- Maximizes AI score while minimizing opponent score  
- Guarantees unbeatable performance (perfect play = tie only)  

### Code Structure
- Object-Oriented Design – clean classes for game and players  
- Modular functions for readability & maintainability  
- Strong error handling

## 🎯 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/KaustubhMukdam/tic-tac-toe.git

cd tic-tac-toe

2. Run the game:

python tic_tac_toe.py

---

📊 Simulation Modes

Watch AI vs AI battles (5 games per run)

Real-time statistics on wins, losses, and ties

Great for understanding optimal strategies

---

📚 Learning Outcomes

Implementing classic algorithms (Minimax + Game Theory)

Practicing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Designing intuitive CLI-based user experiences

Balancing algorithmic complexity with maintainability

---

🔮 Next Steps

Add a GUI version for better visualization

Experiment with alpha-beta pruning to optimize minimax

Extend the project with larger grids (4×4, 5×5)
